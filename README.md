# Jocular Julius - Frontend

## Introduction

Jocular Julius is an engaging Latin teacher voice chatbot designed to make learning Latin fun and interactive. It is built on a versatile framework and can be easily adapted for various other use cases.

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Crafted with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: Engineered using Python and FastAPI.

### Runtime Flow
1. The user enters a voice prompt in the frontend UI.
2. Frontend sends the voice file blob to the backend.
3. The backend utilizes OpenAI Whisper API for speech-to-text conversion.
4. OpenAI GPT-4 API processes text.
5. GPT-4 response is converted to speech using Eleven Labs API.
6. The resulting speech blob is played back in the frontend UI.

### Key Features
- **Realistic Voices**: Lifelike voice responses for enhanced user interaction.
- **Customizability**: Easily adaptable to meet diverse use cases.

### Limitations
- Response times may range between 5-10 seconds due to multiple backend API calls. Expect longer response times during peak traffic hours. But the wait is worth it, and the response will be entertaining. 
- Autoplay of responses may not function on some mobile browsers.

### Project Notes
- Project started in March 2023, preceding OpenAI's voice capability addition to its iPhone app in November 2023.
